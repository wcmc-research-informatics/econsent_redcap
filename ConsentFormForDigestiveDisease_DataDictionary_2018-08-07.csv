You were selected as a possible participant because you have been referred to a provider at Weill Cornell Medical College - New York Presbyterian Hospital. It is important that you read and understand several general principles that apply to all who take part in this project. Taking part in the study is entirely voluntary. You may decide not to participate or you may decide to stop participating in the study at any time without loss of any benefits to which you are entitled. The purpose and nature of the clinical database and tissue bank, possible risks, your rights as a participant, and other information about the study are discussed below. You are urged to ask any questions you have with members of the research team. You should take whatever time you need to discuss the research with your provider and family. The decision to participate or not to participate is yours. If you decide to participate, please sign and date where indicated at the end of this form.

Portions of the clinical database and tissue bank will take place at facilities of New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH), where investigators are members of the medical staff. New York Presbyterian Hospital is neither a sponsor nor an investigator for this study.

why_is_this_research_being_v2,hipaa_authorization_and_informed_consent_form_for,"Why is the study being done?",descriptive,"This purpose of this project is to collect and store patient information (including protected health information), family histories, and tissue samples and to make these available for future research about digestive disease-related disorders (i.e. inflammatory bowel disease or cancers of the GI tract). Investigators at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and collaborators at other institutions are collecting information about patients and family members with digestive disease-related disorders, as well as studying their tissue in the laboratory. By studying the clinical course of patients with digestive disease disorders and their family and performing additional laboratory studies, we hope to learn more about these disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

what_is_involved_v2,hipaa_authorization_and_informed_consent_form_for,"What is involved in the research?",descriptive,"The purpose of this consent form is to ask your permission to collect your clinical information and tissue samples for research purposes. In addition, we are asking your permission to store your blood and a portion of surgery specimen for research studies to be performed now and possibly in the future. Under certain circumstances where it is not possible to obtain a blood sample (i.e. if the researchers are unable to get access to a vein to draw blood), you may be asked to provide a saliva sample through a provided mouthwash kit instead of having your blood drawn. These kits will either be provided for you at the time of your visit once you are consented with a prepaid return envelope, or shipped out to you with a prepaid return envelope. The goal is to extract the DNA from the saliva sample similar to the process of extracting DNA from the blood sample.

If you take part, we will record your clinical information in a database. Most of this information will be derived from your medical records at WCMC-NYPH. However, if you are not seen at WCMC-NYPH, we may contact you or your provider to update our information. It is very important that our records are as complete as possible. Therefore, if you plan to move, please update us with your new contact information. We may periodically ask you to complete questionnaires that ask about your disease and symptoms relating to your disease. If you take part in this study, we may collect tissue samples from you at the times you are already having samples collected from a standard of care procedure. The tissue used will be leftover tissue not needed for diagnosis. Also, extra blood may be taken for research purposes at the time you are already having a clinical blood draw. You will not be required to have additional needle sticks (or blood draws) performed as part of this study. You may be asked to complete questionnaires every 6 months for the first 2 years of your participation and then annually after that. We may periodically contact you by email or by phone call with updates on research that is applicable to you.

Many of the studies to be performed have been planned at this time, but others will be thought of later as new information comes to light. Examples of this use include, but are not limited to, evaluation of proteins and genes (DNA). Genetic material contains information about many different traits, like a personal diary. The traits being tested are heritable, which means that they may be passed on from generation to generation within families. Because genetic testing can have consequences for you as well as your family members, please read this consent form carefully before making a decision about whether or not to participate.

However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, we encourage you to talk to the researcher and your doctor first. The clinical information and tissue you give WCMC under the study will be kept in a database/tissue bank or used by another party forever.

If you give permission, the researchers could use or share with the people identified in this authorization any protected health information related to this research from your medical records and from any test results including, but not limited to genetic testing, HIV testing, and hepatitis testing.

If you give permission, the researchers could also use your protected health information to develop new procedures or commercial products. They could share your protected health information with the research sponsor, the WCMC IRB, inspectors who check the research, government agencies and research staff. The information that may be shared could include your medical record number and your research record related to this database/tissue bank. They may not be considered covered entities under the Privacy Rule and your information would not be subject to protections under the Privacy Rule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your clinical information (including protected health information) is being collected while you are participating. This information may be shared with other investigators. Since your personal health information will be used, there is the risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to protect your privacy. The government does not require everyone who might see your information to keep it confidential, so it might not remain private. 

Efforts will be made to protect your medical records and other personal information to the extent allowed by law. We use a coding system that protects the identity of individuals who provide samples. The coding system has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). However, we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. If information goes to an outside entity then the privacy rule may not apply. You will not be identified personally in any reports or publications resulting from this research study. Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law.

A new Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This law generally will protect you in the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research.
<LI>Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.
<LI>Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information that we get from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment.
</UL>
Be aware that this new Federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. Nor does this Federal law prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, it is possible that genetic tests will show a link between your genetic information and a disease or condition. Know this information may help you make choices about you or your family's health care. However, some individuals prefer not to know about their genetic information. At the end of this document, you will have the opportunity to tell us whether or not you want to be contacted in the future. Your decision about future contact will not affect your ability to participate in this research.

<U>Risks and Benefits of Future Contact:</U> WCMC wants you to know that there may be both risks and benefits to consenting to future contact.

The potential risks include: You may be upset to learn that you have a greater chance of having a disease or condition. Even if genetic tests show that you do not have a greater risk of disease, you may still be upset if you know that others in your family have that higher risk of disease.

The potential benefits include: You may benefit from the knowledge that you or your family have a predisposition to a certain disease or condition. This knowledge may help you make informed decisions concerning your lifestyle and health care.

The costs associated with any testing or treatment that is required from these test results will be the responsibility of you and your insurance provider.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
